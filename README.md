## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cwhui1001/InvoiceManagement.git
   cd InvoiceManagement
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   
   # n8n Configuration (optional)
   N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=your_n8n_webhook_url
   N8N_API_KEY=your_n8n_api_key
   
   # Application Settings
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   
   Run the SQL migrations in your Supabase project:
   - Execute files from `/supabase-migrations/` folder in order
   - Set up storage buckets using `supabase-storage-setup.sql`

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
